This is the first step of my new journey. From now, I will be posting an article at the end of every month summarizing my activities throughout the month. This will serve for two purposes. Firstly, it will act as my monthly self reflection. I will be reviewing my activities for past month and set goal for next month. Secondly, it will help me to break the ice and create a habit of regular posting.

I will be reviewing my activities on the following categories:

- **Learning:** The things I have learned throughout this month. This will include professional, personal, tech or non-tech topics.
- **Reading:** The online coure I read or watched this month
- **Writing:** The number of post I have wrote this month. This will include the monthly self-reflection posts.
- **Productivity:** The amount of productive time I have spent both for professional and personal tasks. I am using [Toggl Track](https://toggl.com/track/) for tracking my productive time.
- **Screen Time:** The amount of time I have spent on mobile devices. This exclude the screen time I have spent in computer. The goal is to reduce average screen time.
- **Health:** The amount of time I have slept and the time/distance I have exercised.
<!-- - **OSS Contribution:** Any contribution to open-source project. This include my own OSS projects or any third-party projects. -->
- **Toy Project:** The best way to learn is to do it yourself. I will be doing simple, small projects with the things I have learned.
